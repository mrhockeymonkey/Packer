# Answer Files

The best way to create an answer file is to use Windows Systems Image Manager. This tool is part of the Windows ADK (see below for link to download). You can simply edit the XML for quick customization but SIM will let you know which features/options are available for the different server version. 

Simply mount the iso, open SIM and click File > Select Windows Image > Browse to D:\sources\install.wim. From here you can create a new answer file.
